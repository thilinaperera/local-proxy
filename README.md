# Local Proxy with Traefik v3 & HTTPS

A Local reverse proxy powered by **Traefik v3** with full **HTTPS** for Docker Compose–based development. Route multiple local services to friendly domains with **trusted, locally issued certificates**.

---

## ✨ What you get
- **HTTPS locally** via [mkcert] certificates
- **Pretty domains** like `api.eng-local.app` instead of ports
- **Traefik dashboard** to see routers/middlewares
- **Zero-collision** networking via a shared Docker network
- **Copy‑paste examples** to expose your own containers

---

## ✅ Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  - Windows: **Docker Desktop** recommended
  - macOS: **OrbStack** recommended
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) installed

> **Why mkcert?** It generates locally trusted certs by adding a CA to your system keychain — no browser warnings once set up.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thilinaperera/local-proxy
cd local-proxy
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust if needed.

Install and generate certificates (first‑time mkcert users must install the local CA):
```bash
# First‑time only
mkcert -install

# Issue a cert for the root domain and all subdomains
mkcert -cert-file certs/local-cert.pem -key-file certs/local-key.pem "eng-local.app" "*.eng-local.app"
```

Create the shared Docker network (Traefik and your apps will attach to this):
```bash
docker network create local-proxy || true
```

Start Traefik:
```bash
# If your Docker uses Compose < v2 you can also run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open the dashboard:
- https://traefik.eng-local.app/dashboard/

> If the domain doesn’t resolve yet, see **Add local domains** below.

---

## 🧭 Add local domains (DNS/hosts)
You’ll access services via domains under `eng-local.app`. Point the names you need to `127.0.0.1`.

**Option A — /etc/hosts (simple):** add explicit names you plan to use

``` sh
127.0.0.1 traefik.eng-local.app
127.0.0.1 api.eng-local.app
127.0.0.1 web.eng-local.app
```

> Note: `/etc/hosts` doesn’t support wildcards. Add entries per subdomain you actually use.

---

## 🧩 Expose your app through Traefik

Attach your service to the **`local-proxy`** network and add Traefik labels. Example `docker-compose.yml` service:

```yaml
api:
  image: containous/whoami:latest # replace with your image
  container_name: auth-api
  networks:
    - local-proxy
  labels:
    # Enable Traefik for this container
    - "traefik.enable=true"

    # HTTP router
    - "traefik.http.routers.api.rule=Host(`api.eng-local.app`)"
    - "traefik.http.routers.api.entrypoints=https"   # use TLS entrypoint
    - "traefik.http.routers.api.tls=true"

networks:
  local-proxy:
    external: true
```

> The bundled Traefik config is already set up to use the `certs/local-cert.pem` and `certs/local-key.pem` you generated with mkcert.

---

## ✅ Verify it works
1. Ensure `api.eng-local.app` resolves to `127.0.0.1` (see **Add local domains**).
2. Start your service and Traefik:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d # or: docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Visit **https://api.eng-local.app/** — you should see your service with a valid lock icon.
4. Visit **https://traefik.eng-local.app/dashboard/** for routing details.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Browser shows “Not secure”**
  - Run `mkcert -install` again and restart the browser to trust the local CA.
  - Make sure you used the exact domain in the cert (`eng-local.app` / `*.eng-local.app`).
- **Domain doesn’t resolve**
  - Add the subdomain to `/etc/hosts` (or configure a wildcard resolver).
- **404 from Traefik**
  - Check the router rule label matches the host you’re visiting.
  - Confirm the service and Traefik are on the same Docker network (`local-proxy`).
- **Dashboard unreachable**
  - Ensure `traefik.eng-local.app` resolves to `127.0.0.1` and Traefik is running.

---

## 🧹 Stop & clean up

Stop Traefik:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Remove the shared network (only if you no longer use it for any service):

```bash
docker network rm local-proxy
```

To remove the local CA/certs created by mkcert, see mkcert’s README.
